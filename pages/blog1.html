        <span class="heading">1. Introduction</span>
        <p>
            Software Engineering is an engineering discipline that is concerned with all aspects of software production. Software engineering is a direct sub-field of engineering and has an overlap with computer science and management science. It is also considered a part of overall systems engineering.
Evidence-Based Software Engineering is an approach to software engineering where evidence gathered from research is taken into consideration as it promises a number of benefits by encouraging integration of research results with a view to supporting the needs of many different stakeholder groups [1].
Since late 80s and early 90s, upon research it was found that the failure to organize medical research in systematic review could cost lives [2]. Since then, medical researchers have adopted the evidence-based paradigm. The success of evidence-based medicine has led other fields to adopt the same approach. Successful innovation in a discipline that, like software engineering, attempts to harness scientific advances for the benefit of society, is worth investigating.

        <span class="heading">2. Why evidence is important in software engineering?</span>
        <!-- <img src="../images/blog-1.jpg" alt=""> -->
        <p>
            As software intensive life-critical systems are taking a central place in our lives, Evidence Based Software Engineering becomes very important. If software can be made more reliable, usable, re-usable and useful, the quality of life of the citizens can be greatly improved. This in turn will make more stakeholders and investors happy which in turn will lead to higher interest and investment in future similar projects. 
There are many ways in which the dependability of software involving adaptation of better software development procedures and practices. At a high level, the Capability Maturity Model and SPICE suggest procedures for improving the software production process [1]. There Are many other high-level strategies but all of them are in some ways limited by the technologies, i.e. methods, tools and procedures that they use.
But to successfully implement this, we need data/evidence and a lot of it at that. In most cases, the software is built with technologies that we have very little usable evidence to begin with. This affects the software in terms of stability, quality, cost and other limitations. This makes it very difficult to predict that using one process will prove better than the others.
Hence data collection to generate useful evidence is very important if Evidence-Based Software Engineering is to provide the mechanisms needed to assist practitioners to adopt appropriate technologies and avoid inappropriate ones [1].
        </p>
        <span class="heading">3. What does Evidence-Based Software Engineering aim to accomplish?</span>
        <p>
            The goal of Evidence-Based Software Engineering is to provide the means by which current best evidence from research can be integrated with practical experience and human values in the decision-making process regarding the development and maintenance of software [1]. All this needs to lead to these things-

<ul>
    <li>Research groups and individual researchers needs to ensure that all their research is directed to the requirements of the industry.</li>

    <li>There need to be standard means by which industry practitioners can make rational decisions about technology adaptation based on said research.</li>

    <li>There need to be ways in which the dependability of a software intensive system can be improved.</li>

    <li>Ensure that software is not the bottleneck for efficient use of these systems.</li>

    <li>Ensure increased acceptability amongst users.</li>

    <li>An input to certification processes.</li>
</ul>
        </p>
        <span class="heading">4. Evidence-Based Software Engineering in practice.</span>
        <p>
            As the Medical Field is considered one of the most successful industries to adopt an evidence-based methodology, a lot of the inspiration for the practice of evidence-based methodologies comes from Evidence-Based Medicine. A part of the reason for this for might be the ease with which the basic steps taken in Evidence-Based Medicine can be adopted to other fields. Sackett et al [3]. identify 5 steps that are needed too practice Evidence-Based Medicine. These steps are shown in Table 1 below along with the viewpoint of Software-Based Software Engineering
